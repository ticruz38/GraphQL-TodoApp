# GRAPHQL BOILERPLATE

This boilerplate is made of 2 express server:
  - graph is the graphql server
  - web serve static files and SSR the webpage

To start the project go in each folder, follow the instructions in the README in each sub-folder

When you are all set you should have 3 process running
2 express server and one webpack-dev-server to build client static files.

Tips: You should open both folder (web and graph) as root folder in vscode to take advantage of the debugging vscode settings in each folder.
